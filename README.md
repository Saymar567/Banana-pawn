# Banana-pawn
## The game
This is the game where the banana-pawn needs to eat...yes, you have guessed well, bananas! Although it is not a minion, it behaves like them, so let's feed the pawn with a lot of bananas. 
Be careful, though, because there are minions over there that want to bananas too, and pawn starves to death if you don't give it bananas...

## How it works
- Create the chess-board
- Create the pawn
- Create the minions and make them appear in the chessboard randomly
- Create the movements of pawn
- Create the bananas and make them appear in the chessboard randomly
- Store the points
- Store the lives
- When you get to 0 lives, you lose
-
